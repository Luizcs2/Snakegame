# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built in Java. The game is implemented using Swing components, and you can play it in the terminal by running the compiled Java program.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 8 or above)
- A terminal to run the game

## Steps to Run the Game

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luizcs2/Snakegame.git
   cd Snakegame
Navigate to the src directory:
The Java source files are located inside the src directory.

cd src
Compile the Java files:

Use the javac command to compile all the Java files in the com/zetcode package:
javac com/zetcode/*.java


After compiling the Java files, you can run the game with the java command:
java com.zetcode.Snake

This will start the Snake game in a new window, and you can begin playing!
Controls

Arrow keys: Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to control the snake's direction.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
